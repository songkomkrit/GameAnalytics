# Game Analytics


## Description
This is a class project. It extends the exisiting codes on SpaceWars game originally written by Dan Petersson. Please visit <https://github.com/DanPetersson/SpaceWars> for futher details.

A player name must be entered before the game starts. A player receives a coin when earning additional five scores. His/her type is known right after finishing each game. A game ends when it is over or when a player accidentally quits the program. In this project, four player types (Baffa, Bicalho, & Feijo, 2019) are available:

  1. hardcore achiever,
  2. hardcore killer,
  3. casual achiever, and
  4. casual killer.

This classification is based on average performance of an individual player collected in a server log. NETPIE (Network Platform for Internet of Everything) is used as a cloud platform. The *microgear* package is required. Please visit <https://netpie.io> for more information.
